September 2, 1994
November 4, 1995 - updated for 3DES
November 15, 1995 - updated 3DES for 3 independent keys
April 29, 1999 - repackaged into separate portable and x86 versions

This archive includes optimized DES and EDE 3DES code in portable C.

Contents:

readme - this file
readme.des - details on the des functions and some measured speeds
des.h - Header file defining user accessable functions
desport.c - DES encrypt/decrypt function in portable C
des3port.c - Triple DES encrypt/decrypt function in portable C
deskey.c - DES key scheduling function in portable C
des3key.c - Triple DES key scheduling function in portable C
gensp.c - Generate combined S/P box source files dessp.c and desspa.c
descert.c - DES certification driver, reads and verifies NIST test suite
des3cert.c - Triple DES certification driver, reads and verifies NIST test suite
testdata - test data for descert.c
descycle.c - DES exerciser. Executes DES in output feedback mode, printing
   a line of ciphertext every 10,000 encryptions
unixtime.c - DES timing test for UNIX. Executes DES 1 million times. Invoke
   with UNIX 'time' command to measure execution time.
dostime.c - Same as unixtime.c, but for DOS. Measures time internally.
makefile - Makefile for portable C version

Making the "certify" target will build the certification routine and
execute it. This echoes each test vector as a text line to standard
output followed by OK if the test passes.

The triple DES certification routine uses the same test vectors as
single DES with K1==K2==K3. This causes the triple DES routine to behave
identically to a (slow) single DES routine.

The executables for the GNU asm versions are named differently from the
C versions (the assembler versions have 'a' appended to their names).
